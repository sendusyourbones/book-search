# Book Search Engine

## Description

This site enables users to search for books to see their titles, descriptions, authors, and images, as well as links to navigate to entries for the books on Google Books. Users are not required to have an account in order to search for books and view results, but they have the ability to create an account if they want to save any books to a personal collection of books they are interested in.
